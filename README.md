## ðŸ§  FocusMate â€“ 
I created this project to help students study faster and in a more enjoyable way. Instead of reading through long PDFs, FocusMate gives a short quiz with 7 multiple-choice questions based on the fileâ€™s content.
The quiz pulls random questions each time you try it. I wrote these questions manually using a real educational PDF I had. Itâ€™s built with Python and Flask, without using any database â€” it just relies on sessions. and it shows your score right after you finish.

## Why I Made It?
I wanted to practice and develop my Python skills by building something useful. The idea came from helping my sister study â€” I thought -as a computer science graduate- what if i could turned her PDF into a quiz?

## Tools I worked with
 â€¢ Python & Flask
 â€¢ PyMuPDF for reading PDFs
 â€¢ HTML/CSS for the frontend
 â€¢ Jinja2 templates
 â€¢ No database, just session management

In the future, I plan to add features for users to upload any PDFs they have, and use NLP modules to generate questions dynamically from any topic.
